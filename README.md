# PIT_tag_processing
These scripts are intended to summarize lengthy PIT tag data files for use in characterizing hypothermia

I assume they are useful to very few individuals (namely, Cole and I), but if you have conducted trials like this and find these useful I'd love to hear from you!

Description to come...just leaving these here for Cole for now.
